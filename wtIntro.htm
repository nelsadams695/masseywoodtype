Eye-catching, iconoclastic, grotesque, ornamented, and instantly recognizable  wood display faces were the raw material for advertising, posters,
and public announcements throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth. The Roy Gurney Collection at the Robertson Davies Library consists
of 356 fonts of wood printing type dating from the 1850s to the 1960s, primarily of pantograph-and-router-cut endgrain hardwood but representing a
range of manufacturing methods including die-cut, hand-cut, and veneer types and ornamental borders.
<br/>
&#8195;&#8195;This index is intended to facilitate access to the collection. We continue to develop the index, working to print specimens of each font of type,
and to identify each one by linking it to existing specimen books. It is hoped that as more institutions, presses, and individuals sort and catalogue
what wood type they have, a network of similar indexes will allow printers and scholars to generate more knowledge about wood type, to identify more
faces, and to better preserve this important aspect of printing history.
<br/>
&#8195;&#8195;The Roy Gurney collection is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the development, design, manufacture, and use of wood type over the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  including designers, printers, historians of type design, students, and general interest users. The
collection is supported by a range of wood type specimen books and the print collections of the library.
<br/>
&#8195;&#8195;If you are interested in learning more about the collection, please contact the College Printer, Nelson Adams: nelsadams695@gmail. If, as you browse the index, you have additional information
about any of the fonts listed here, including potential identifications, please contact us. This index is in beta. If you have any feedback about
your experience using the index, we want to hear from you!
