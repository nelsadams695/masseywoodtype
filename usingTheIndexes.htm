          Welcome to the Robertson Davies Library Wood and Metal Type Indexes.
              <br/>
              &#8195;&#8195;In whatever column you are currently sorting by, the list of items has a white background,  and the column-header
              has an orange background. If you want to sort by the contents of a different column, click on that column's header.
              <br/>
              &#8195;&#8195;Not every column needs to be displayed at all times. You can limit your display to show only the information that
              is relevant to you by using the section called "show or hide columns". If a column is currently showing, it will
              appear in black in this section. If it is not showing, it will appear in grey. If you want to hide a column that
              is currently showing, click on its name in the "show or hide columns". If you want to show a column which is
              currently hidden, click on its name in the "show or hide columns" section.
              <br/>

          &#8195;&#8195;An example from the Wood Type Index: If you were interested in seeing what die-cut types are present within the collection, sorting by "Manufacturing
              method" would group the items in the collection using manufacturing method as the primary criterion. Ensure that
              this column is displaying by making "method of manufacture" black in the "show or hide columns" section. Next,
              click on the "Mfg. Method" column header. The header will turn orange, the column will turn white, and the items
              will be arranged by manufacturing method. Scroll down until you see "die cut", and there you have every font of
              type or ornamental piece which was made using the die cut method.
